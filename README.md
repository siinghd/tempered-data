# Tamper Proof Data

At Bequest, we require that important user data is tamper proof. Otherwise, our system can incorrectly distribute assets if our internal server or database is breached. 

## Research and My Solution
After doing research, I looked at different ways to keep our data safe from tampering. Here's what I found:

### Blockchain
- First considered for its tamper-resistance capabilities
- Deemed too complex and performance-intensive
- Determined to be overengineered for the requirements

### Hardware Security
- Evaluated TPM and HSM solutions
- Found to be highly secure but cost-prohibitive
- Implementation across distributed systems would be challenging

### Special Databases
- Investigated WORM (Write Once Read Many) databases
- Considered append-only logging systems
- Insufficient security features for requirements

## Selected Approach
Opted for a multi-layered security solution incorporating verification systems and intelligent backup management, prioritizing simplicity and effectiveness over complexity.

## Production Implementation Requirements

- Background queue system for backup management
- Geographically distributed backup storage
- Request rate limiting implementation
- Enhanced monitoring and alert systems
- Automated backup retention management
- Hardware security for key storage
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Backup system health monitoring

## Main Security Questions

### 1. How does the client ensure that their data has not been tampered with?

#### Cryptographic Signatures
- Asymmetric cryptography implementation for data signing
- Dedicated KeyManager for secure key operations
- Signature verification for data integrity and authenticity

> ðŸ’¡ Think of this like a unique fingerprint for your data. Each piece of data gets a special "signature" that can't be copied. Any modification invalidates the fingerprint.

#### Canary System
- CanaryManager implementation for integrity verification
- Early detection system for unauthorized changes
- Independent verification protocol

> ðŸ’¡ Similar to a security guard checking ID at building entry. Each data access requires a valid token for verification.

#### Authentication Tags
- AES-GCM encryption with integrity verification
- Ciphertext integrity protection
- Immediate modification detection

> ðŸ’¡ Comparable to a tamper-evident seal on medicine bottles - any tampering breaks the seal and alerts the system.

#### Version Control
- Version creation for all modifications
- Prevention of silent data changes
- Complete modification history

> ðŸ’¡ Like taking a photo of each change, creating an unalterable record of modifications.

### 2. If the data has been tampered with, how can the client recover the lost data?


#### Automatic Backup System
- Pre-modification backup creation
- Multiple recovery point maintenance
- Secure backup storage implementation

> ðŸ’¡ Similar to saving multiple copies of important documents in different secure locations.

#### Version Restoration
- Restoration capability to any valid version
- Integrity verification during restore operations
- Timestamped version history

> ðŸ’¡ Functions like a time machine for data, allowing return to any verified previous state.

#### Emergency Recovery
- Automatic valid backup restoration
- Recovered data integrity verification
- Recovery operation API endpoints

> ðŸ’¡ Acts as an automatic safety system, like sprinklers activating during a fire.

#### History Management
- Searchable version history system
- Manual recovery point selection
- Resource management through cleanup processes

> ðŸ’¡ Similar to an organized filing system for backups with automatic cleanup of unnecessary files.
